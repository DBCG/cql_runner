[CQL Runner](http://cql-runner.dataphoria.org/) implementation.

## Introduction

HTML-based Clinical Query Language (CQL) Runner

- Allows you to run CQL commands against a pre-existing CQL Engine from the comfort of your own browser

â€“ Runs against the [CQL execution service](https://github.com/DBCG/cql_execution_service) (feel free to point to the execution service in your own project)

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version *webpack*.

## Dependencies

The CQL Runner has the following global dependencies: 

1) [NodeJS/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) v6.9+ 
Simply download and install as per site instructions

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm install` at `~/source/` to install packages

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Note: If the project fails to build after you pull latest, you may have to manually clear your `~/source/node_modules` folder and reinstall the packages.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
