## Introduction

[![Angular 2 Style Guide](https://mgechev.github.io/angular2-style-guide/images/badge.svg)](https://angular.io/styleguide)

HTML-based Clinical Query Language (CQL) Runner

- Allows you to run CQL commands against a pre-existing CQL Engine from the comfort of your own browser

â€“ Runs against the [CQL execution service](https://github.com/DBCG/cql_execution_service) (feel free to point to the execution service in your own project)

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version *webpack*.

## Dependencies

The CQL Runner has the following global dependencies: 

1) [NodeJS/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) v6.9+ 
Simply download and install as per site instructions

2) [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version *webpack* + 
In your console, run `npm install -g @angular/cli@1.0.0`

## Build

Run `npm install -g` -- This installs global dependencies

Run `npm install` -- This installs local dependencies

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Development server
Navigate to /source/ and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

*Note that on Windows, you might see some error messages when serving--it should still work just fine. This is a documented Angular CLI bug and should be fixed in the next patch*

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
