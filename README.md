# CQL Runner

## Introduction

[![Angular 2 Style Guide](https://mgechev.github.io/angular2-style-guide/images/badge.svg)](https://angular.io/styleguide)

HTML-based Clinical Query Language (CQL) Runner

- Allows you to run CQL commands against a pre-existing CQL Engine from the comfort of your own browser

â€“ Runs against the [CQL execution service](https://github.com/c-schuler/Cql_Engine/tree/master/Src/java/cql-execution-service) (feel free to point to the execution service in your own project)

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version *webpack*.

## Dependencies

The CQL Runner has the following global dependencies:

1) [NodeJS/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) v4.5+
Simply download and install as per site instructions

2) [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version *webpack* +
In your console, run `npm install -g angular-cli@1.0.0-rc.1`

## Build

Run `npm install -g` -- This installs global dependencies

Run `npm install` -- This installs local dependencies

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Development server
Navigate to /source/ and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

*Note that on Windows, you might see some error messages when serving--it should still work just fine. This is a documented Angular CLI bug and should be fixed in the next patch*

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Integration as an AngularJS component

cql_runner can be used as a component within a larger AngularJS application in a few steps. First, add it to your package.json:

	...
	"cql-ace-syntax": "1.2.0",
	"cql-runner": "1.0.9",
	....

Next, include the modules in your app.modules.ts (or equivalent):

	...
	import { RunnerModule, ApiService } from 'cql-runner';
	...
	@NgModule({
		imports: [
			RunnerModule,
			...
		],
		providers: [
			ApiService,
			...
		],
		...
	})

Now, make sure the ace.js file is added to your vendor dependencies. In grunt, for example:

		copy: {
			build: {
				files: [{
					cwd: 'node_modules/cql-ace-syntax/',
					src: "ace.js",
					dest: 'build/',
					expand: true
				}]
			}
		}

Include ace.js in your HTML

	html
		head
			script(src="ace.js")

You can now use cql_runner as a component within your application. Attribute defaults are show, below:

	cql-runner(
		engineUri="'http://cql.dataphoria.org/cql/evaluate'",
		engineUser="'username'",
		enginePass="'password'",
		termUri="'http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3'",
		termUser="'username'", termPass="'password'",
		dataUri="'http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3'",
		dataUser="'username'", dataPass="'password'")
